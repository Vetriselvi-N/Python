# Multiple Assignment 
#In python, we can assign multiple variables and values in one single line.

a=10
b= 15.5
c="20"
print(a)     # 10
print(b)     # 15.5
print(c)     # 20

#Instead of this we can use multiple assignment method 

a,b,c= 10, 15.5,"20"
print(a,b,c)    # 10 15.5 20

a=b=c= 20
print(a,b,c)    # 20 20 20

# We can store Srting values also

a,b,c="Apple",2.4,"True"
print(a,b,c)   #Apple 2.4 True


#String Methods

#len()----> used to find the length of the string
#strname.find()----> used to find the index position of the char of the particular string
#strname.capitalize()--->used to change the 1st Index vale in the uppercase
